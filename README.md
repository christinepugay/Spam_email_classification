# Spam_email_classification

Almost all business transactions today are communicated via email systems. These transactions can range from online purchases, promotions, to job offers. With the rise in popularity of emails as a way to communicate, spam emails have also increased. Spam emails are unsolicited emails sent to recipients, such as advertisements, that contain links to phishing sites that capture recipientsâ€™ personal data. Captured data from these sites are then used to perform cyber crimes such as online fraud and identity theft. Floods of spam emails are as dangerous as they are annoying for recipients. According to statistica.com, the top three industries affected by phishing are financial, Saas, and e-commerce, causing businesses billions of dollars each year. We aim to solve this expensive problem.

In this project, I aim to build a classification model that identifies whether an email is a spam
email or not. We will examine commonly used words and phrases used in various types of spam
emails and use this analysis to build our classification model. Successfully modeled, this can be
implemented into emailing systems that will separate spam emails from the folder, helping
recipients avoid these fraudulent activities.
